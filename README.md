### EMMANUEL MUKIRA : 3rd APRIL 2023

## Project Description
-This project reflects a part of me which I recently chose to explore which is Stoicism.
-This Web Application allows a user to pick one of the three greatest philosophers in Human history which is: Epictetus, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.
-Afterwards it allows a user to randomly generate a stoic quote from them.
-A user will be able to like that particular quote and leave a comment on it.
